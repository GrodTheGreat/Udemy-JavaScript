**_The #1 bestselling JavaScript course on Udemy!_**

**_Just updated with ES2024 and ES2025!_**

_"Really, really well made course. Super in-depth, with great challenges and projects that will solidify your Javascript understanding. I found the lectures were paced perfectly -- Jonas doesn't skip over anything that might be useful to a JS developer"_ — Carson Bartholomew

JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.

That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!

**Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?**

_This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications._

You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through **practical and fun code examples**, **important theory** about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and **beautiful and complete projects**.

You will become ready to continue learning advanced **front-end frameworks** like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte.

You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need in your developer job.

And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so **you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript** from the ground up!

But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's "The Complete JavaScript Course". In fact, it's like many courses in one! **But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course**. That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.

_By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer._

**Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?**

My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 850,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.

I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. **It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges**, that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.

**So what exactly is covered in the course?**

- Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns
- Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more
- Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining, and more
- How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.
- Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
- Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. \[This is like a small standalone course\]
- Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. \[This is like a small standalone course\]
- Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel, Babel, and ES6 modules
